/// A SwiftUI view that is able to scan barcodes, QR codes, and more, and send back what was found.
/// To use, set `codeTypes` to be an array of things to scan for, e.g. `[.qr]`, and set `completion` to
/// a closure that will be called when scanning has finished. This will be sent the string that was detected or a `ScanError`.
/// For testing inside the simulator, set the `simulatedData` property to some test data you want to send back.
