# Gimmi
Gimmi is an app developed as final projects of the Design and Implementation of Mobile Apps course; my team decided to develop Gimmi with the objective of substituting scanning devices already present in some supermarkets (for example, the ones used in “Pronto Spesa” service of Esselunga) with customers’ mobile phones providing smart features that would make the experience smoother, faster and smarter.
The main points have been allowing users to complete their shopping session from their phone, from the scanning of the products to the payment process and the collection of the receipt.
The main functionalities of this app are the following:
• Authentication using Google and Apple’s own APIs in order to provide a smooth registration process
• Multiple supermarket support with an easy and quick search based on the user’s location
• The possibility of navigating through the products’ catalogue of the selected supermarket while also providing a visual representation of each product
• An easy shopping experience empowered by the device’s capabilities and supported by an Apple Watch companion app
• A quick and flexible checkout process that lets the user choose which payment method he/she prefers between cash and credit card
• An easy and quick way to see the receipt associated to your payment which also contains a QRCode need to exit from the turnstiles
